# Spike
A spike, usually in Agile environments, is a quick, exploratory programming task aimed at gaining knowledge or solving a specific technical/design issue.

## Process
1. Define a specific goal.
2. Set up a timebox - few hours/a day/a couple of days.
3. Conduct the spike - researching solutions/integrating different systems/coding/testing various approaches.
4. Review and document findings.
5. Make decisions on how to proceed with the larger project.
