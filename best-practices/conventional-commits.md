# Conventional Commits

Source: https://www.conventionalcommits.org

This topic was brought up during a discussion with a fellow FarmData2 developer. I always wondered if there is some kind of standard for git commits, and it seems like there is.

Conventional commits is a "specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages."

The convention is pretty simple: "\<type of commit\>[scope]: \<description\>".

The reason this is important isn't just because the standard looks nice. It's also to help with the automation of CHANGELOGS. Thankfully, we don't have to completely memorize all the formats - there are extensions that aid in conventional commits.
