# China's Thousand Talents Plan

This topic came up while talking with a friend about immgration policies.

The Thousand Talents Plan is a Chinese government initiative launched in 2008 to attract highly skilled overseas professionals to work in China. There is a similar "Young Thousand Talents" plan focusing on young STEM scholars.

- Cause: To reverse the trend of talents leaving the country and remaining abroad (mainly US).

- Target Group: It focuses on attracting top-tier overseas talent, including scientists, entrepreneurs, and professionals, particularly those with expertise in scientific research, innovation, and entrepreneurship.

- Incentives: Participants are offered competitive salaries, research funding, lab space, and other incentives to establish their work in China.

- Impact: The program has been successful in attracting thousands of high-level professionals to China, significantly contributing to the country's advancements in science and technology. However, The Thousand Talents Plan has also been a subject of international scrutiny and controversy, particularly from the United States, due to concerns over intellectual property theft and security.

This initiative highlights the strategic moves by nations to harness global talent for technological supremacy.
