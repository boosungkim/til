# Sorting
Key concepts:
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Bubble sort

Key patterns:
- Overlapping segments
Detect/merge/manipulate overlapping segments in intervals.
Key idea: Sort intervals, then iterate to check for overlaps, merge, or count conflicts.
Common: Scheduling problems, resource allocations, start/end pairs.
