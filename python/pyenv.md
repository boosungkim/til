# NVM for Python: Pyenv

For a project that I am working on right now, I am required to use Python `3.8.2` specifically. My machine uses `3.11`, and I was told that trying to install multiple versions of Python globally could cause other programs to break down.

Luckily, there is something called `Pyenv`, which is something like `nvm` for Python. I used the `pyenv` installed from https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv, after installing other base softwares.

Using `pyenv` is as simple as running `pyenv install 3.8.2` and `pyenv versions`. I am using PyCharm at the moment, and it can easily be integrated with `pyenv`.

Another hurray for open source!
