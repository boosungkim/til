# How to handle a space in the section title

Let's say that you have a section title that reads `## Story time`. Sometimes, `[Story time](#story-time)` will work, but not on platforms like GitHub and Obsidian.

On such platforms, it is worth trying `[Story time](#story\time)`, where you replace the space with a forward slash. This resolved the issue for me on Obsidian.
